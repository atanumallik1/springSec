Basic auth needs to send credentials in every call; so it is best suited for external communication 

* with web browser you will see an input box for the credentials 
* this is not a good approach for application ; so application can pass the following header 
````
Authorize : Basic base64(username:password)
```` 
example value  `Basic dXNlcjphYmMxMjM=`
