## Basic Authentication with SPring Boot
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8110582/124506704-d96f4a80-dde9-11eb-9bf9-795b62a8c532.png)

Basic auth needs to send credentials in every call; so it is best suited for external communication 

* with web browser you will see an input box for the credentials 
* this is not a good approach for application ; so application can pass the following header 
````
Authorize : Basic base64(username:password)
```` 
example value  `Basic dXNlcjphYmMxMjM=`

In Postman


## User Details Service
Allows define a user details service `UserDetailsService`. 
We need to a User with following properties 
* Username ( Must have )
* Encoded Password ( Must have )
* Roles ( Must have )
* authorities ( Optional but highly recommended )
* and more 

### InMemoryUserDetailManager 
`InMemoryUserDetailManager` is a `UserDetailService` 


### Roles
`Role` s comes with `Permission`
![Image](images/Roles.png)
In this picture  `Admin` is a Role and there are 4 `Permissions` in it

Roles are Assigned to `Users`

## Enforcing API based Authentication 
We can enforce Role based authentication or Permission based authentication 


### Role based Authentication 
Only students can access URL which starts with `/api/`. Notice that we are using `hasRole`
````
 @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {

	http.authorizeRequests() // Any request must be authenticates
		.antMatchers("/", "/index").permitAll() 
		.antMatchers("/api/**").hasRole(ApplicationUserRole.STUDENT.name())
		.anyRequest().authenticated().and().httpBasic(); // mechanism for authentication is basic

    }
    
````

### Permission Based Authetication 

Authority = Permission

![Image](./images/PermissionBAsedAuth.png)
We can enforce it in the configure nethod
We are using `hasAuthority()`
````
.antMatchers(HttpMethod.PUT ,"/management/api/v1").hasAnyAuthority(ApplicationUserPermissions.COURSE_WRITE.name())
		.antMatchers(HttpMethod.POST ,"/management/api/v1").hasAnyAuthority(ApplicationUserPermissions.COURSE_WRITE.name())
		.antMatchers(HttpMethod.DELETE,"/management/api/v1").hasAnyAuthority(ApplicationUserPermissions.COURSE_WRITE.name())
		.antMatchers(HttpMethod.GET ,"/management/api/v1").hasAnyRole(ApplicationUserRole.ADMIN.name(), ApplicationUserRole.ADMINTRAINEE.name())
		
````
We can also do it by annotation on a method. For it following steps are needed  
````
@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(prePostEnabled = true)
public class ApplicationSecurityConfiguration extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {

    	// to make it work with authorities 
    	http.csrf().disable() //TODO :Never do this
	    .authorizeRequests() // Any request must be authenticates
		.antMatchers("/", "/index").permitAll() // except these urls
		.antMatchers("/api/**").hasRole(ApplicationUserRole.STUDENT.name())
		.anyRequest().authenticated().and().httpBasic(); // mechanism for authentication is basic

    	
    	

    }
